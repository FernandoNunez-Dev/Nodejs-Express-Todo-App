<h3 align="center">With This Application<h3>
<p align="center">

I utilized nodejs templating engine [EJS](https://ejs.co) to create a Todo App. I also utilized
node's [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework on the backend. EJS or Embedded Javascript Templating is a templating engine used by [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/). Template engine helps to create an HTML template with minimal code. Also, it can inject data into  HTML template at the client side and produce the final HTML. EJS is a simple templating language which is used to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It also helps to embed JavaScript to HTML pages

<h3 align="center">I Incorporated Express</h3>
<p align="center">

Now, the first thing I needed to do is to set EJS as the templating engine with Express which is a Node.js web    application server framework, which is specifically designed for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web  applications. It has become the standard server framework for node.js.
